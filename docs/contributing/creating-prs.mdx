## Accepted PRs

Before you dive into making code changes, you should understand whether your work is likely to get merged!

Generally accepted PRs:
- Bugfixes (for known or newly identified issues)
- [Open issues](https://github.com/magnitudedev/magnitude/issues), especially issues that are affecting or blocking multiple people.

However, if there's something else you plan to implement - feel free to create an issue for it or run it by us on Discord first. You can wing it and create the PR too, but no guarantees it will be accepted.

<Info> If you're ever not sure if a PR is likely to get accepted, feel free to ping us on Discord. Keep in mind that even a working implementation of a feature or resolving an issue may recieve additional scrutiny based on conventions or quality. </Info>

Other general guidelines:
- Changes in `magnitude-test` are more likely to be accepted quickly as the surface area to gain feature-parity with other test runners is quite large.
- Changes to `magnitude-core` may also be accepted but may want to run these past us on Discord first.

        2. Click "Fork", name it whatever, then "Create fork"
        3. Clone your fork locally

        We regularly keep an eye out for new PRs - and may leave comments about any additional changes you may need to make in order for your PR to be merged.

        Once we've taken a look - if the PR looks good, it'll be merged and you'll officially be a Magnitude contributor 😎

        Upon the next release, your changes will be live and everyone can enjoy your contributions! 🎉

## PR Checklist

There's a few things you should be sure to do in any PR. Please follow these steps to help your PR get merged smoothly.

### ✅ Manually verify your own changes
You should confirm your changes are working as expected, for example by using yalc to publish and test locally (see [local testing](/contributing/setup#local-testing)).

### ✅ Add a clear description
If you've implemented a new feature, give example usage that demonstrates what changes you've made. You should also describe what you've done to confirm that your changes are working as expected (any manual testing).

### ✅ Create a `changeset` describing your changes:

Once you've made your other changes, run this from monorepo root:
```
bun changeset add
```
In this menu, add a comment describing your change. Unless it's a big change and you've received confirmation that your change should be a `major` or `minor` version bump, ensure that your changeset is marked as `patch`.

Commit this changeset file. This will ensure that the next release is tracking your change and will credit you as the author for the change.

### ✅ Update docs

If you've made a dev-facing change and there is an appropriate place in the docs that needs updating, feel free to do so.

This is not required, but we appreciate it!
